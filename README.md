# AIR-QUALITY-OF-INDIA-ANALYSIS-IN-PYTHON
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of air quality in India using Python. The dataset utilized contains information on air quality parameters across different cities in India. Through this analysis, we aim to identify cities with the worst air quality and provide insights into pollution levels.

Key Steps:

1)Data Preprocessing:

Importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and visualization tools.
Loading the dataset and checking its structure and completeness.
Handling missing values by dropping rows with null values.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing average Air Quality Index (AQI) for specific cities (Delhi, Hyderabad, Amritsar, Patna) over time.
Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and summary of air quality parameters.
Identifying cities with the highest and lowest AQI readings.

3)Insights from Data:

Visualizing cities with good and severe AQI ratings to highlight regional disparities.
Providing insights based on data analysis, such as identifying Delhi as facing the most severe pollution.

4)Modeling (Optional):

Generating dummy data to simulate air pollutant levels and associated health effects.
Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes) to predict health issues based on air pollutant levels.
Evaluating model performance using mean squared error (MSE).

Conclusion:
This project offers valuable insights into air quality in India, highlighting cities with the most critical pollution levels and potential health implications. Additionally, machine learning models provide a framework for predicting health effects based on pollutant concentrations.
